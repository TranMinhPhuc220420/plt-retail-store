2. **API Request Layer**:
   - `src/request/ingredientInventory.js` - Complete inventory API integration

3. **Inventory Management Components**:
   - `src/components/inventory/IngredientStockInModal.jsx` - Advanced stock in with batch/expiration tracking
   - `src/components/inventory/IngredientStockOutModal.jsx` - Smart stock out with FIFO and expiration warnings
   - `src/components/inventory/IngredientStockTakeModal.jsx` - Physical count and variance tracking
   - `src/components/inventory/IngredientTransactionHistoryModal.jsx` - Comprehensive transaction history

4. **Management Pages**:
   - `src/pages/admin/ingredient/InventoryManagement.jsx` - Complete inventory dashboard
   - Enhanced `src/pages/admin/ingredient/index.jsx` - Ingredient CRUD management
   - Enhanced `src/pages/admin/IngredientManagement.jsx` - Master dashboard
